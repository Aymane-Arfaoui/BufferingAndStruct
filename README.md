**Buffering and Structures**

** Purpose and Learning Outcomes:**
- Better understanding of C
- Understanding pointers.
- Learning the basics of buffering (will be used a lot more as we go).
- Learning block operations
- Reading hexadecimal dump and understanding binary representation of data in memory and how it can be used for debugging and ensuring your code works.
- More on planning and approach to projects

**general expectations for all projects:** 
- All projects are done in C in the Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine.
- Code must be neat, with proper and consistent indentation and well documented. 
- Keep line to around 80 characters per line, and not line greater than 100 characters.
- Comments must describe the logic and reason for the code and not repeat the code.  
- Variables must have meaningful names and be in a consistent format (I do not care if you use camelCase or under_scores in variables but be consistent.
- You must use `make` to compile the program.
- You must use `make run` (sometimes with RUNOPTIONS) to execute the program.
- In addition, each file must have the standard header as defined below.
- All source files and writeup must be in the main branch of the github.
